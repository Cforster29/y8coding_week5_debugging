age = input("How old are you?")

print("Nice to know you are", age, "years old!")


### What was wrong ?
### DISCUSS HERE:
### This was a runtime error because the variable name exists and it is suggested that it is supposed to be used in the third line, but in the third line the variable used is a one that is not defined, seen as 'old.'
### Was this a... syntax, logical or runtime error?
