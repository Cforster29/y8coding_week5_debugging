num1 = input("Give me a number: ")
num2 = input("Give me another!")
print("I'll add them for you!")
print(num1 + num2)



### What was wrong ?
### DISCUSS HERE:
###i think this was a syntax error. due to the fact that the code has not used tge coomand 'int' to specify that the input is an integer in the code.
### Was this a... syntax, logical or runtime error?
